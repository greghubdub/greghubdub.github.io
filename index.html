	<h1>Fun with Ferments</h1>
	<h2 id="intro">Fermentation: What is it?</h2>
	<p>Fermentation is the process of cultivating a culture of anaerobic bacteria and/or yeast. It's especially useful for preserving foods, as well as transforming them into something new and special. Some products of fermentation that you may or may not be familiar with:</p>
	<ul class="lists">
		<li>Pickles</li>
		<li>Sauer kraut</li>
		<li>Coffee</li>
		<li>Beer</li>
		<li>Wine</li>
		<li>Kimchi</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Fermentation at Home</h3>
	<p>It's easy to get started creating your own examples of fermentation at home. For sauer kraut made from cabbage, a large crock is the best device to use. See our <a href = "table.html"> ferment types page</a> for more specific information on what you can create at home. </p>

	<h4>Cultures</h4>
	<p>Many ferments are made simply by brining the food, such as cabbage in the case of kraut and kimchi. Others must be cultured, that is, you add a SCOBY (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast). Kombucha and kefir are two examples.</p>
	<h5>Tools of the Trade</h5>
	<p>As referenced in the table on our <a href = "table.html"> ferment types page</a>, you'll need some tools that you may or may not yet have around the kitchen. These include the following:</p>
	<ul class="lists">
		<li>crock (not a slow cooker, but a huge ceramic jar as seen above)</li>
		<li>jars and bottles for bottling your product for storage</li>
		<li>a kraut masher, like a baseball bat with a large flat bottom for mashing cabbage</li>
		<li>starter cultures, like a SCOBY or kefir grains, if you're interested in kombucha or kefir</li>
		<li>books to guide your journey, such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Fermentation-Depth-Exploration-Essential/dp/160358286X">The Art of Fermentation by Sandor Katz</a></li>
