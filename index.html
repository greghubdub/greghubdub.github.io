	<h1>Fun with Ferments</h1>
	<h2>Fermentation: What is it?</h2>
	<p>Fermentation is the process of cultivating a culture of anaerobic bacteria and/or yeast. It's especially useful for preserving foods, as well as transforming them into something new and special. Some products of fermentation that you may or may not be familiar with:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Pickles</li>
		<li>Sauer kraut</li>
		<li>Coffee</li>
		<li>Beer</li>
		<li>Wine</li>
		<li>Kimchi</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Fermentation at Home</h3>
	<p>It's easy to get started creating your own examples of fermentation at home. For sauer kraut made from cabbage, a large crock is the best device to use. See our <a href = "table.html"> ferment types page</a> for more specific information on what you can create at home. </p>

	<h4>Cultures</h4>
	<p>Many ferments are made simply by brining the food, such as cabbage in the case of kraut and kimchi. Others must be cultured, that is, you add a SCOBY (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast). Kombucha and kefir are two examples.</p>
